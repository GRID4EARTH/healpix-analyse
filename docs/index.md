# healpix-analyse: Spherical Analysis on HEALPix

`healpix-analyse` is a Python toolkit for analysing signals defined on HEALPix spherical grids,
with a focus on Earth Observation (EO) data. All operators are implemented in PyTorch and are
fully differentiable through `torch.autograd`.

## Why healpix-analyse?

Where [healpix-geo](https://healpix-geo.readthedocs.io/) focuses on **where** pixels are,
`healpix-analyse` focuses on **what you do** with the signal values stored in those pixels:
spherical harmonic transforms, power spectra, gauge-equivariant convolutions, and multi-resolution
up/downsampling operators.
